# sorting

## Algorithms

This is a small collection of some sorting algorithms and an interface for visualization and comparison in Python.
The following algorithms are currently featured:

- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Quick Sort
- Shell Sort
- Merge Sort
- Tree Sort
- Heap Sort
- Radix Sort
- Bogo Sort

## Measurments

These values are measured in the interface. Note that time and memory may vary from correct values due to measurement effort and system/computer.

- Time (in Seconds)
- Memory (in Kilobytes)
- Iterations
- Comparisons
- Array Reads
- Array Writes
